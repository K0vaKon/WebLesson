            <p>Canon's corporate philosophy is kyosei. It conveys our dedication to seeing all people, regardless of culture, customs, language or race, harmoniously living and working together in happiness into the future.
                Unfortunately, current factors related to economies, resources and the environment make realizing kyosei difficult.
                Canon strives to eliminate these factors through corporate activities rooted in kyosei. Truly global companies must foster good relations with customers and communities, as well as with governments, regions and the environment as part of their fulfillment of social responsibilities.
                For this reason, Canon's goal is to contribute to global prosperity and the well-being of humankind as we continue our efforts to bring the world closer to achieving kyosei.
